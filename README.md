## Introduction

Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, where the goal is to assign items to predefined categories or classes based on their characteristics. This project showcases the application of classification algorithms to two different types of data:

- **Autism Image Classification**: Using the VGG16 model, we classify images to determine whether they contain signs of autism or not.

- **Fungi Tabular Classification**: Employing a simple algorithm with a single neuron and sigmoid activation, we classify tabular data to categorize fungi instances.

## Datasets

### Autism Image Dataset

The autism image dataset used for image classification can be obtained from the following link:

### Fungi Tabular Dataset

The fungi tabular dataset used for tabular classification can be found on Kaggle:

## Algorithms

### Autism Image Classification

We use the VGG16 model, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), to classify images for signs of autism. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step demonstration of the image classification process.

### Fungi Tabular Classification

For the fungi tabular classification, a simple classification algorithm with a single neuron and sigmoid activation is employed. This straightforward approach serves as an illustrative example of tabular data classification.
